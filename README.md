# Reinforcement-Learning-Research-Project

The aim of this project is to explore Q-Learning in the context of Tic-Tac-Toe and other applications using python. Theoretical Q-Table was generated using the "minimax" algorithm, and was compared to Q-Tables generated through training against both, random and perfect opponent. Deep-Q-Learning was investigated in the context of different games in the "Open-AI gymnasium". 



<h2>To access the code:</h2>

1. Clone the repositry

    ```git clone ```

2. Install the required packages

    ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
3. ```Part 1: Tic Tac Toe/q_learning_lib.py``` and ```Part 2: Deep Q-Learning/deep_q_learning_network_lib.py``` are the libraries which contain all the necessary functions

4. For results, check out the report at ```Report/Latex/main.pdf```, analysis at ```Part 1: Tic Tac Toe/results_and_analysis.ipynb``` and videos at ```Part 2: Deep Q-Learning/videos```

<h2>Note:</h2>

1. Generative AI was used during this project. Mainly for small helper functions and some of the mathematics and logic with Deep Q-Learning.

2. ```Part 2: Deep Q-Learning/CartPole-v1.py``` and ```Part 2: Deep Q-Learning/LunarLander-v3.py``` are made using generative AI to test my small Deep Q-Learning library
