\chapter{Background}

\section{Tic-Tac-Toe}
Tic-Tac-Toe is a simple two-player game on a 3 by 3 grid. 
The game originated in ancient Egypt atleast 1300 BC.
Players take turns placing X's and O's in the grid with the goal of getting 3 in a row.
The game is drawn with perfect play from both sides, but O's have to be precise to garantee a draw.
